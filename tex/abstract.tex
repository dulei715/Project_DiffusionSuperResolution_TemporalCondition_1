Time series forecasting is essential for data-driven decision-making across finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation, yet existing methods—including deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers) and diffusion models—suffer from rigid fixed-length input windows, insufficient multi-scale pattern modeling, and limited spatial-temporal correlation utilization. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Multi-Resolution Conditional Diffusion Model (MR-CDM), which integrates three core innovations: adaptive delay embedding that converts variable-length time series into structured 2D images while preserving temporal dependencies, hierarchical multi-resolution trend decomposition that extracts coarse-to-fine trend components, and a conditional diffusion process guided by multi-scale context to reduce generative randomness. Experimental results on four real-world datasets (Electricity Load, Traffic Flow, Weather, Solar-Energy) show MR-CDM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (CSDI, TimeGrad, Informer, Autoformer) by 5.9–9.9\% in MAE and 6.0–8.9\% in RMSE on average, with ablation studies confirming the critical role of each component (e.g., 11.2\% MAE improvement from multi-resolution decomposition). Theoretical analyses verify its statistical consistency (KL divergence bounded by $O(1/\sqrt{N})$) and computational feasibility ($O(S \cdot L \log L)$ FLOPs), offering a robust paradigm for variable-length, multi-scale time series forecasting.
